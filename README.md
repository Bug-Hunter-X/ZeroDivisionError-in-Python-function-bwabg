This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates a common runtime error: ZeroDivisionError. The bug.py file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.py provides a corrected version that handles potential division by zero.  The issue arises from attempting to divide a number by zero, which is mathematically undefined and causes the program to crash.
